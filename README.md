# foodtruck
Website to track food trucks depending on location

# Problem
Create a service that tells the user what types of food trucks might be found near a specific location on a map.

# Installation
Clone into a targeted folder and run npm start to start the server. 

# Technologies used and reasoning
Back-end
- NodeJS
- Express
- Node Socrata

Front-end
- Jquery
- Sass
- Bootstrap
It was a fairly small application so multiple technologies wasn't necessary. Node and Express was used to build the backend while the frontend was all Jquery and Bootstrap mainly. In a larger project I would've probably used Sequelize and Postgres for back-end databases, and react/redux as the front-end framework. In fact, I'm probably going to fork this repo and build this up into a proper project later this week.
